#Motivation :
I have used Django web-framework for this project. Django helps in fast prototyping. Many reknown mnc are using django in scalable projects as quora, disqus, pinterest and firefox etc so it is reliable. Django provides us a built-in admin panel so that we can focus on other parts of project. Django ORM is a good concept for easy querying. Apart from all these reasons one main reason Why I chosen django for this project is that I only know Django and trying to learn other backend and frontend libraries as node and react.

#steps to run the project
1. To activate the Virtual Env Run "source env/bin/activate" after moving in project directory
2. Now run the command "python manage.py runserver"
3. After running the server you can test the project working by entering urls as '/accounts/signup' or 'accounts/login'
4. admin panel can be accessed by '/admin/'. Username : "kk" & password : '123'
